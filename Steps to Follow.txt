1. Use pre-trained VGG19 weights, to get large content representation.
2. Input style image to the network, to get target matrices.
3. Pass the copy of content image to get it's content and style representation.
4. Calculate distance of target content from genrated image and calculate corresponding content and style.
5. Define total loss, with content and style as component.
6. Use gradient descent to update pixels so that th eabove olss is minimized.
