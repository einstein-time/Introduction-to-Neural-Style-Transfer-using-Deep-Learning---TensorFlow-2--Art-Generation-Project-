This uses deep learning to compose one image in the style of another image. 
This is known as neural style transfer and the technique is outlined in A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.

This demonstrates the original style-transfer algorithm. 
It optimizes the image content to a particular style. 
Modern approaches train a model to generate the stylized image directly (similar to cyclegan). 
This approach is much faster (up to 1000x).

Things to be learnt:
TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/) or 
how to use a style transfer model with TensorFlow Lite. 
This project is based on the Neural style transfer using Tensorflow.
