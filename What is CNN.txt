What does CNN do?
System should understand the image.

This requires taking the raw image as input pixels and building an internal representation that converts the raw image pixels into a complex understanding of the features present within the image.

Starting from the network's input layer, the first few layer activations represent low-level features like edges and textures.

As you step through the network, the final few layers represent higher-level features—object parts like wheels or eyes.

Since the CNNs try to understand the images, they are able to generalize well: they’re able to capture the invariances and defining features within classes (e.g. cats vs. dogs) that are agnostic to background noise and other nuisances.

Things we are goung to do:
We'll access the intermediate layers of the model, to describe the content and style of inout images.
So, therby we would use the intermediate layer of model to get content and style representatoin of image.
